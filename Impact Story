                                                          Virtualahan Training Journey
Hi! I'm Alexis Barredo and i'm a hard of hearing person since when i was 12 years old. I was diagnosed of ear infection when i was a kid, because of salt water.
Back on the year 2020-21 i was doing nothing because of pandemic, but i have side hustle before, suddenly i wasn't able to continue that because lack of source of supply.
I also applied on site job before the pandemic, but most of them are not responding after you pass your CV, so i decided to continue my side hustle.
On the late year of 2021 i was browsing on social media to find a job that suitable for me and i found a facebook group of person with disability, but most of job hiring there is too far from my place.
So i was browsing in the group and i found a shared post of "Virtualahan" so i stalk the pages. I saw there that they have a digital training skills for PWD or any other person, but the problem is i dont have a pc/laptop, i also broke my hearing aid in the middle of pandemic.
And i decided to sell some of my remaining thrift clothes and save some money atleast i can buy a low specification desktop so i can enroll here because there's a scholarship training for pwd here.
I am now on training here, and i learned some Digital skills here, like Lead Generation( Finding Email & Finding Domain), E-Commerce( Amazon & eBay) Product Sourcing.
Also basic Graphic Designing:(Affinity Designer & Canva) we did some social media poster designing. Wordpress Management, i did basic website making. On this course i'm still practicing/studying some Management Tools, so i can apply this skills for my future job.
My Experience here was good, the tech we're so kind for assisting us on our activites,attendance, and some misunderstanding.
